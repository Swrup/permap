# What is Permap

Permap is a open source geo-message-board software written in OCaml.

Permap was initially made to be a gardening/permaculture forum.
Permap's aim is to help people find friends with similar interests around them
and build local communities.

You can make threads with geographical coordinate, 
this way you can find people near you doing interesting stuffs, 
socialize with them and share local knowledge. 

## Permap's future

- Make permap federate

- More than coordinates

Make threads on anything with a geographical position.
Instead of making threads with a simple (latitude * longitude) data,
we want to be able to make threads on any OpenStreetMap's item/ActivityPub object 
that can resolve to a geographical position.
